# Rain2D for Godot 3

Addon for creating top-down style 2D rain.

Based on the frontview 2D rain demo by (https://github.com/securas/raindemo).
Mostly rewritten and ported to Godot 3.

Sample droplet sprite courtesy of securas.

# Features
 
* Top-down screen-size based rain
* Animated splash rain drop collision
